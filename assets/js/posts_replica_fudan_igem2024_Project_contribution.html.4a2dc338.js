This process requires the introduction of various genetic modules through plasmid transformation. Each plasmid introduces metabolic demands on the host bacteria, and understanding the impact of these modules on <em>E. coli</em>&#39;s growth is essential for optimizing bacterial performance.</p><p>To assess the plasmid burden on <em>E. coli</em>, we employ the Spot Assay, a technique traditionally used in yeast genetics to measure cell viability and growth. The Spot Assay offers a high-throughput, efficient alternative to optical density measurement of liquid culture, allowing us to compare bacterial growth across different plasmid combinations. By spotting serial dilutions of <em>E. coli</em> cultures onto agar plates, we can quickly evaluate how different plasmids affect bacterial fitness, both with and without induction. Our approach is well controlled. The same plasmid DNA could be transformed several times to generate multiple plates for measurement, or different colonies from the same plates could be spotted, not only ensuring reproducibility, but also provide oppotunities to examine colonal variations.</p><p><a href="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5115/measurement-sy/spot-assay-data.csv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Data from the Spot Assay</a> helps us gauge the metabolic impact of the plasmids and informs the development of our <a href="/fudan/software/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Software</a>, which predicts plasmid-induced stress on <em>E. coli</em>.</p><h2 id="inclusivity" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#inclusivity"><span>Inclusivity</span></a></h2><p>We launched the &quot;STEAMed&quot; project (science, technology, engineering, art, mathematics, and medicine), promoting a two-way dialogue between our team and individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), allowing us to improve our approach based on their genuine feedback and needs.</p><p>Our personalized, picture book-based lessons combine science, technology, engineering, art, and medicine, tailored for different ASD subgroups through partnerships with rehabilitation centers.</p><p>By engaging the public through charity sales and media outreach, we aim to highlight the remarkable scientific potential of those with ASD.
