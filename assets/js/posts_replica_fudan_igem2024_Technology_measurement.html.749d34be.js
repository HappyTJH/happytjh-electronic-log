This method is particularly valuable for comparing how different genetic modifications, such as plasmid transformations, genetic deleteions or mutations, affect microbial growth in a controlled and high-throughput manner<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#footnote3">[3]</a><a class="footnote-anchor" id="footnote-ref3"></a></sup>. In our project, where <em>E. coli</em> is engineered to absorb and convert nickel ions, the Spot Assay serves as an essential tool to evaluate how these transformations impact bacterial fitness.</p><h4 id="applicability-and-advantages" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#applicability-and-advantages"><span>Applicability and Advantages</span></a></h4><p>In a Spot Assay, dilutions of bacterial culture are spotted onto agar plates, without or with inductants, and incubated for colony formation<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#footnote4">[4]</a><a class="footnote-anchor" id="footnote-ref4"></a></sup>.

We use the same starting culture for each plate, plotting it onto different plates with varying conditions, including negative controls without induction and positive controls with well-characterized plasmids to validate the accuracy of our results. This approach allows for direct comparison of growth patterns under distinct environmental influences while maintaining a controlled baseline. These controls ensure precise calibration, reliable interpretation, and reproducibility of our findings. By utilizing Spot Assays, we can systematically assess the metabolic burden imposed by different plasmid combinations on <em>E. coli</em>, ensuring that the introduced plasmids do not compromise overall cellular performance under varying conditions.</p><h2 id="spot-assay-protocol" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#spot-assay-protocol"><span>Spot Assay Protocol</span></a></h2><h3 id="step-1-start-a-bacterial-culture" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#step-1-start-a-bacterial-culture"><span>Step 1: Start a bacterial culture</span></a></h3><p>Inoculate a single colony of <em>E. coli</em> BL21(AI) containing the plasmid of interest in 3 mL of LB broth supplemented with the appropriate antibiotic.
