The wastewater will flow through our apparatus prior to discharge, with nickel being recovered on the way.

Our hardware ensures that the nickel microparticle filled <em>E. coli</em> will remain in the buffer pools.</p><p>The nickel microparticles will sediment at the bottom of the pool, accumulate through time and form layers of nickel deposit.

With MINERAL&#39;s highly modular design, adapting the system for new metals simply involves substituting the relevant transport and binding proteins in the bioaccumulation system, making it a versatile platform for metal recovery.</p><p>Moreover, the concept of bioaccumulating heavy metals and forming reserves could be applied in more visionary contexts, such as terraforming Mars. In a future scenario, engineered microorganisms like those in MINERAL could help sequester toxic metals or produce essential materials, aiding in the creation of a habitable environment on other planets.</p>',15)]))}]]),o=JSON.parse('{"path":"/posts/replica_fudan_igem2024/Project/implementation.html","title":"Implementation","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"title":"Implementation","author":{"name":"Kevin Qi","url":"/fudan/team/#kevin-qi"},"headergif":"https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5115/header/mplementation-header-new.gif","description":"Overview With the ever-increasing demand for nickel, the scale of nickel mining and industrial processing will inevitably expand.
